## 🧠 Memory System

Faster Chat can learn about you across conversations — your preferences, projects, tech stack, and communication style. Memories are extracted automatically after each response and injected naturally into future chats.

- **Three-level control**: Global toggle (admin), per-user toggle, per-chat opt-out
- **Zero latency impact**: Extraction happens asynchronously after the response streams
- **Full transparency**: View, delete individual facts, or clear all memories from Settings
- **Configurable extraction model**: Use a cheap/fast model (e.g., Haiku, GPT-4o-mini) to minimize cost
- **Privacy**: Memories are strictly user-scoped. No admin access to user memories.

## 🔍 Web Search

When enabled, the AI can autonomously search the web and fetch pages to answer questions with up-to-date information.

- **Brave Search** integration with encrypted API key storage
- **SSRF-protected** URL fetching with DNS validation and private IP blocking
- **Source citations** displayed as clickable pills with favicons below the response
- **Real-time status**: "Searching the web..." and "Reading {domain}" indicators during tool execution
- **5-minute cache** for repeated queries, max 5 results per search

## 🖼️ Image Support

**Vision/Multimodal**: Upload images alongside messages for analysis by vision-capable models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Grok, Mistral, and more).

**Image Generation**: Toggle image mode to generate images with configurable aspect ratios (1:1, 16:9, 9:16, 4:3, 3:4, 3:2, 2:3).
- **Providers**: OpenAI (DALL-E 3), Replicate (FLUX 1.1 Pro), OpenRouter image models
- Generated images display inline with download controls and metadata

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-Click Docker Deploy (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1337hero/faster-chat.git
cd faster-chat
docker compose up -d
```

That's it. Open http://localhost:8787, register your first user (becomes admin), and configure your AI providers.

**With HTTPS** (for production):
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.caddy.yml up -d
```

### Local Development

**Prerequisites**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (recommended) or Node.js 20+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1337hero/faster-chat.git
cd faster-chat
bun install
bun run dev
```

**On first run**, the server automatically generates encryption keys and initializes the database.

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Server**: http://localhost:3001

> **Important**: Backup `server/.env` — contains the encryption key for stored API keys.

### First-Time Setup

1. **Register an account** at http://localhost:3000/login
   - The first account is automatically promoted to admin
2. **Configure AI providers** in the Admin Panel (`/admin` → Providers tab):
   - Add OpenAI, Anthropic, or other cloud providers with API keys
   - Configure local providers (Ollama, LM Studio) with custom endpoints
   - API keys are encrypted and stored securely server-side
3. **Enable models** in the Admin Panel (Providers tab → Refresh Models)
   - Select which models appear in the chat interface
   - Set default model for new chats

![Themes](themes.png)
*New Appearance Options, to change colors and fonts*

![White Labeling](white-label.png)
*You can now white label and customize the app title and icon*


### Using Offline with Ollama

```bash
# Install Ollama (macOS/Linux)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# In Faster Chat: Admin Panel → Connections → Search "Ollama" → Add
# Then: Admin Panel → Models → Click "Pull Model" on Ollama row → Enter model name
```

You can pull models directly from the Admin Panel—no CLI needed! Just click **Pull Model** next to your Ollama provider, enter a model name (e.g., `llama3.2`, `mistral`, `codellama`), and watch the download progress in real-time.

The Provider Hub auto-discovers 50+ providers including Ollama, LM Studio, OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Mistral, OpenRouter, and more. Just search and add.

## 💻 Development

### Commands

**Root (recommended)**
```bash
bun run dev         # Start frontend + backend concurrently
bun run build       # Build all packages for production
bun run start       # Run production builds
bun run clean       # Remove all build artifacts
bun run format      # Format code with Prettier
```

**Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
bun run dev         # Vite dev server on :3000
bun run build       # Production build to dist/
bun run preview     # Preview production build
```

**Backend**
```bash
cd server
bun run dev         # Hono dev server on :3001
bun run build       # Build for production
bun run start       # Run production server on :3001
```

## 🐳 Docker Details

The Docker setup uses a hybrid build (Bun for deps, Node.js 22 runtime) with SQLite storage in a persistent volume.

**HTTPS with Caddy**: For production with automatic Let's Encrypt certificates:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.caddy.yml up -d
# Edit Caddyfile with your domain, point DNS, restart
```

See `docs/caddy-https-setup.md` and `docs/docker-setup.md` for details.

### Configuration

**Environment Variables** (`server/.env`):

```bash
# Required: Encryption key for API keys
API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY=...  # Generate with crypto.randomBytes(32)

# Optional: Configure via Admin Panel instead
APP_PORT=8787              # Internal port (default: 8787)
NODE_ENV=production        # Environment mode
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///app/server/data/chat.db

# For local Ollama access from Docker
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434
```

**Common Commands:**

```bash
docker compose up -d                # Start
docker compose logs -f              # View logs
docker compose down                 # Stop
docker compose up -d --build        # Rebuild

# Reset database
docker compose down
docker volume rm faster-chat_chat-data
docker compose up -d
```


## 🔐 Forward Proxy Auth (Authelia, Authentik, oauth2-proxy)

Off by default. When enabled, the reverse proxy becomes the sole source of identity:
the password login screen is bypassed, and `/api/auth/login`, `/register`, and
`/change-password` all return 403.

```bash
PROXY_AUTH_ENABLED=true
PROXY_AUTH_TRUSTED_PROXIES=172.16.0.0/12       # required — IPs/CIDRs, or '*'
PROXY_AUTH_USER_HEADER=Remote-User             # or Remote-Email
PROXY_AUTH_GROUPS_HEADER=Remote-Groups
PROXY_AUTH_ADMIN_GROUP=chat-admins             # optional
PROXY_AUTH_ADMIN_USER=admin@example.com        # optional
PROXY_AUTH_AUTO_PROVISION=true
PROXY_AUTH_LOGOUT_URL=https://auth.example.com/logout
```

**Trust boundary.** Identity headers are honored only when the connecting peer matches
`PROXY_AUTH_TRUSTED_PROXIES`, and the server refuses to start if that list is empty.
Keep the app on the proxy's network and never publish its port — anything that can
reach it from a trusted IP can assert any identity.

**Accounts.** A local account is created the first time an identity is seen. Set
`PROXY_AUTH_AUTO_PROVISION=false` to restrict access to accounts an admin created
ahead of time. Provisioned accounts have no password and can never be used for
password login, even if proxy auth is later turned off.

**Admin.** Comes from `PROXY_AUTH_ADMIN_GROUP` (matched against the groups header) or
`PROXY_AUTH_ADMIN_USER` (matched against the identity). Setting either makes the proxy
authoritative — the role is granted and revoked on every request, so removing someone
from the admin group demotes them immediately. Setting neither leaves roles to the
Admin Panel and makes the first provisioned user an admin. Non-admin roles like
`readonly` are never overwritten.

**Caddy example:**

```caddyfile
chat.example.com {
    forward_auth authelia:9091 {
        uri /api/verify?rd=https://auth.example.com
        copy_headers Remote-User Remote-Groups Remote-Email
    }
    reverse_proxy faster-chat:8787
}
```

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Faster Chat has reached its stated goal — a lighter, faster, more private alternative to Open WebUI — and is now in **maintain mode**: quality and polish over new surface area. Everything in the feature list above is shipped and working; what remains is a short list of small, finishable items, each tracked as a PRD in the [open issues](https://github.com/1337hero/faster-chat/issues).

**What's next**:
- Chat export to JSON/Markdown ([#27](https://github.com/1337hero/faster-chat/issues/27)) and Claude import ([#28](https://github.com/1337hero/faster-chat/issues/28)) — closing the data-ownership loop
- Full-text message search ([#30](https://github.com/1337hero/faster-chat/issues/30)), per-chat system prompt/temperature ([#31](https://github.com/1337hero/faster-chat/issues/31))
- Minimal personal prompt templates ([#34](https://github.com/1337hero/faster-chat/issues/34))

**Explicitly not planned**: knowledge bases/RAG, conversation branching, model arenas, MCP, plugin systems, PostgreSQL, mobile apps, i18n, public share links. Each either grows a second product inside this one or is a permanent maintenance tax. A finished tool that stays sharp beats an ambitious one that rusts — don't become Open WebUI.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Faster Chat** is built on these principles:

- **Self-Hosted**: Your data stays on your server. No cloud dependencies.
- **Provider-Agnostic**: Never locked into a single AI vendor.
- **Minimal Runtime**: 3KB Preact, no SSR overhead, instant responses.
- **Offline-Capable**: Run completely offline with local models.
- **Fast Iteration**: Bun for speed, no TypeScript ceremony, clear patterns.
- **Simple Code**: Small focused components, derive state in render, delete aggressively.

### Why No TypeScript?

We chose **speed over ceremony**. TypeScript's compile step and constant type churn across fast-moving AI SDKs slowed development more than it helped.

**Our guardrails:**
- Runtime validation at system boundaries
- Shared constants and clear contracts
- Tests for critical paths
- JSDoc for complex functions

**Trade-off:** Less friction, faster iteration, easier contribution.

See WIKI for detailed coding principles and architecture documentation.

## 🙏 Credits & Acknowledgments

**Faster Chat** is built on the shoulders of excellent open source projects:

**Core Infrastructure**
- [Vercel AI SDK](https://github.com/vercel/ai) — Streaming chat completions and multi-provider support
- [models.dev](https://github.com/sst/models.dev) — Community-maintained AI model database for auto-discovery
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) — Lightweight 3KB React alternative
- [Hono](https://hono.dev/) — Ultrafast web framework for the backend
- [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) & [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) — Modern routing and server state management
- [bun:sqlite](https://bun.sh/docs/api/sqlite) — Fast SQLite driver for server-side persistence

**UI & Styling**
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) — Utility-first CSS framework
- [lucide-preact](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-preact) — Beautiful icon library
- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) — Soothing pastel theme

**External API Calls**

For transparency, this application makes the following external API calls:
- **models.dev/api.json** — Fetches provider and model metadata on server startup (cached for 1 hour)
- **Brave Search API** — Only when web search is enabled and triggered by the AI during a conversation
- **Your configured AI providers** (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) — Only when you send chat messages
- **No tracking, analytics, or telemetry services** — Your privacy is paramount

All data (conversations, memories, settings, API keys) is stored in your self-hosted SQLite database. Nothing leaves your server except API calls to your configured AI providers and optional web search.
